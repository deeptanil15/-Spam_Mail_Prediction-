# Spam Mail Prediction Using Ensemble Learning :  
I developed a spam mail prediction system using ensemble learning, a technique that combines the strengths of multiple machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy. Here's an overview:

## Data Collection:
I gathered a dataset containing labeled emails as "spam" or "not spam," with features like word frequency, special characters, and sender information.

## Data Preprocessing: 
I cleaned and prepared the data by tokenizing text, removing stopwords, and converting features like words and phrases into numerical values using techniques like TF-IDF or Bag of Words.

## Base Models: 
I selected different machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) as base classifiers.

## Ensemble Learning: 
I implemented an ensemble method like Bagging, Boosting (e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting), or Voting Classifier. This allowed me to combine predictions from the base models to create a stronger, unified prediction model.

## Training and Testing:
I trained my ensemble model on the labeled email dataset and tested its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Result: 
The ensemble model successfully predicted whether an email was spam or not, outperforming individual models by reducing overfitting and improving generalization.
